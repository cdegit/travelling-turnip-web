						<h2 class="t-title">Our Topics</h2>
						<p>
							Our process started by deciding on a general topic or theme we would like to explore with our app. As a team, we collectively decided on the intersection between the categories of travel and vegetarian/vegan dietary lifestyles.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Our topic research</h2>
						<p>
							To gain more knowledge on this topic, we interviewed several vegans and vegetarians, both male and female ranging between age 20 and 35, and a mix between local Vancouverites and those living abroad. Through our interviews, we explored what the most complicated or frustrating aspects of a vegan or vegetarian lifestyles were. Through this process we also eliminated several misconceptions we had about veggie diets. One such notion that was debunked was that we assumed that buying local veggie alternatives to popular meat-based dishes would be challenging. However our interviewees almost unanimously explained to us that after the first few times grocery shopping as a vegan or vegetarian, you set up your routine and the process becomes quick and easy - especially if, like most people, you stick to the same brands month after month.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, our interviewees explained to us that this does not apply when travelling, as foreign countries and cultures may not carry the same brands that you are used to back home, or the people in that culture might interpret vegetarianism differently than it is understood in Canada, and this can lead to frustration.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ultimately, we discovered that the vegan/vegetarian experience is diverse, and happens across a broad spectrum. Some vegetarians only casually avoid meat, but if it is inconvenient they will consume it. On the other end of the spectrum, some vegans we interviewed said they refuse to stay at hotels that do not offer vegan-friendly room options (i.e. no down in the pillows, no wool or leather in the blankets or sofas).
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Finalized Topic</h2>
						<span>We initially narrowed this topic into three potential applications:</span>
						<ul class="u-keep-default">
							<li>A crowd-sourced restaurant guide with reviews and meal options</li>
							<li>A grocery shopping aid for new vegetarians and vegans</li>
							<li>A meal-planning aid</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							We decided to move forward with our restaurant guide idea, as it seemed to address the most common issue expressed by our interviewees who all fit on different places within the veggie-experience spectrum. While we felt that our other two concepts would still be useful, they targeted a more specific audience, and the shopping aid in particular would likely have a very short usage life span.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Why this idea?</h2>
						<p>
							Our crowd-sourced restaurant guide concept would address the widespread feedback we received that maintaining a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle while in a foreign country can be particularly challenging and frustrating. Different cultures interpret vegetarianism differently, for example in some countries "vegetarian" options might still include beef or chicken broth (but not visible pieces of meat) - however for many Canadian vegetarians this would not be acceptable to their diet. Furthermore, many cultures have very few foods that do not include either meat of cheese - for example, traditional Italian cuisine is rarely vegan-friendly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Moreover, travelling is becoming more and more popular - especially for young people. Backpacking through Europe or hostel jumping through Asia is a popular way for most people under the age of 30 to spend at least one summer in their life. Beyond this, many vegans and vegetarians travel on business trips with tight schedules, which doesn't leave much room for "trial and error" dining. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, even though our initial interview group consisted of people below the age of 35, our proposed app could still be valuable to older travelers who want to find high quality veggie-friendly dishes. As one of our interviewees explained to us, transitioning to a vegan lifestyle does not mean you can no longer appreciate fine-dining. Our app would facilitate the process of finding refined restaurants serving veggie-friendly options for the foodies of the veggie community.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Elaborating on our idea</h2>
						<p>
							Our initial idea for our app was that it would primarily focus on meals. Through meals, users could find nearby restaurants (which would offer said meal). Furthermore, meals would house "recipes", or home-made variants of the dish which would be supplied by the user community. For example, vegan-style lasagna could be made five different ways by five different people, and so the option of picking and choosing your favourite variant or recipe of a dish could be enticing for users who also enjoy cooking.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our in-app map would should where certain meals could be purchased, or simply what restaurants nearby offer veggie-friendly dishes. User reviews and ratings would help travelling veggies to determine quality and price range of local options which would meet their dietary restrictions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our app would also include a favouriting or "save for later" option, to facilitate revisiting a meal, restaurant and recipe. Users would also be able to submit their own reviews and recipes through a "create" feature.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, we also included a "phrasebook" to facilitate ordering at restaurants. Unlike Google Translate, this Phrasebook would have pre-set options for users to choose from which would guarantee 100% accuracy in translation, which would ultimately lead to fewer misunderstandings and fewer rejected served meals.

				<!-- Creating the App: Our First Steps -->

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Personae</h2>
						<p>
							Once we decided on the theme and content of our app, the next steps were to decide how potential users would actually interact with the product. To do this, we created three hypothetical users or <em class="t-orange">personae</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ryan: A 35-year-old Chinese business man on a work trip to Italy. He only has a short break for lunch, and so he needs to find a vegan meal close by as quickly as possible. His main concern is location.
						</p>
						<p>
							Isabela: A 22-year-old Canadian student traveling abroad in China, on a budget. She wants to find some local ingredients and recipes she can try herself to save money. Her main concern is ingredients.
						</p>
						<p>
							Douglas: A 53-year-old retired American foodie exploring the Philippines. He wants to find food that will meet his restrictions, but will be exquisite at the same time. His main concern is quality.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Framework</h2>
						<p>
							Creating these personae helped us define what aspects of our app users would interact with most frequently, and what elements would likely be most important to them. After generating these hypothetical users, we tried to imagine scenarios where they would use our app, to further understand what elements we should focus on while designing it. To do this, we created <em class="t-orange">interaction frameworks</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this diagram, we explore our persona Ryan's experience in depth, including how he would navigate hiccups in his plan - such as local transit being on strike. This process helps us identify extra features we could add to improve usability, in this case searching by quality or proximity.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Sketches and Grey box mock-ups</h2>
						<p>
							Our next step was to design interface mock-ups. We started with low-fidelity sketches, where all team members generated ideas for the looks, feel and layout of the proposed app. After agreeing upon design elements, we moved on to grey-box mock-ups, or a rough draft. These mock-ups gave us a clearer idea of how the final app would look, without locking us into any final decisions. This allowed us to see our designs in more detail while being unafraid of still changing them.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Colour Mock-ups and Interactive Prototype</h2>
						<p>
							The next step was to finalize our designs and create final quality, coloured mock-ups. We then integrated these into our interactive prototype. This prototype worked on all mobile phones and allowed us to test all of our desired functions in a limited setting. For this prototype, we incorporated one neighbourhood of Italy with a handful or restaurants, meals and recipes available to view and add to favourites. We also incorporated functionality for creating new recipes, meals and restaurant pages, as well as creating a new account.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">User testing</h2>
						<p>
							Once our prototype was functional, we tested it with 10 different potential users. We used IDEO's research methods of Observation and Narration to study how our test users interacted with our prototype. Through Observation, we watched what users did, which buttons they pressed and which ones they didn't, and saw how long on average was required to complete common tasks. Our next method, Narration, involved users speaking aloud their thoughts as they used the app - including voicing questions such as "what does this button do?" or "how can I make the app do this?" This helped us understand what aspects of our design were unclear to users.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">What problems did we find? How did we fix them?</h2>
						<p>
							Through user testing we discovered that our onboarding did not do a sufficient job at explaining what different icons or buttons would be used for. We also found that, overwhelmingly, users did not find the concepts of "recipes" to be useful. Overall, having meals and recipes caused confusion and users were unsure of when they needed to user either of them. Users also showed frustration with our Phrasebook design, many of them continuously generating blank phrase cards because they kept pressing the "create" button expecting a text box and keyboard to appear.
						</p>
						<p>
							To solve these issues, we decided to incorporate menu button images into our onboarding pages to make them easier to understand. We also chose to scrap the concept of recipes completely, and focus or app solely on the restaurant-going experience. Finally, we decided to rework instructions for the Phrasebook and disable the "create" button until the user selected phrases to be translated, thus eliminating the possibility of generating blank phrase cards, and forcing users to read instructions before proceeding.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Our final product</h2>
						<p>
							Our final app focuses on facilitating the experience of trying out new restaurants in a foreign country, for vegans and vegetarians. Our home page showcases local and popular meals to give users inspiration. These meal cards also include ingredients and history of the meal, for user's interests. Our map page allows users to visually understand where they can find meals that suit their dietary restrictions. Our create function allows users to add restaurants and meals for the app's user community. Users can save meals and restaurants to review them later using our favouriting feature. Finally, users can translate pre-set phrases with our Phrasebook feature, guaranteeing 100% translation accuracy.
