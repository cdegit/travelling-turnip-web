						<p>
							Are you a vegetarian or vegan? Do you have travel plans, but you're concerned about finding local meals that will fit with your lifestyle? We're here to help.
						</p>
						<p>
							Travelling Turnip is an app for vegans and vegetarians who want to explore meals and restaurants in a foreign country or culture. We'll show you meal options that meet your needs, and we'll help you order them too. We provide all the information you could want: <em class="t-orange">what is this food made of? Where can I get it? What have others travellers said about it? What is its history in this culture? How can I order it in the local language?</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Let us take the stress and frustration out of your foreign-country restaurant experience, so that you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the meal.
						</p>

						<h2 class="t-title">Onboarding</h2>
						<p>
							Our easy to follow onboarding will explain how to navigate our app's features. Don't worry - if you ever need to brush up on these skills, you can always revisit these tutorials at a later time.
						</p>

						<h2 class="t-title">Sign in or continue as guest</h2>
						<p>
							With Travelling Turnip you can create an account to save your personal dietary specifications so that we always show you meals and restaurants that are right for you. Creating an account also allows you to create meal and restaurant pages for the community, as well as leave reviews. You will only have to go through this process once - don't worry, we'll remember you the next time you open the app. Alternatively, you can skip this step and continue as a guest if you'd like to browse our extensive catalogue of meals and restaurants around the globe.

						<h2 class="t-title">Meals</h2>
						<p>
							Once you open the app, you will be greeted with our mouth-watering Meals page. Here you'll be able to see mini meal cards for popular dishes in your area. You can search for specific meals by name, ingredient, locale, and more. If you find a meal you like, you can favourite it by tapping the heart icon. This will save it for later viewing, and will be accessible on your Favourites page.
						</p>
						<p>
							To learn more about a meal, tap its mini card to open its full page. Here, you'll find a list of ingredients most commonly used to create this dish. You'll also be able to read a little bio about the meal, as well as its history in a local cultural context. User reviews are also available to help you decide if this is the meal for you. If you decide this is what you'd like to eat, you can find out where to get it by tapping the restaurant's button, which will bring you to a map view showing you all the nearby restaurants that serve this dish. Talk about easy!
						</p>
					</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Map</h2>
						<p>
							On the map page you can easily see all the nearby restaurants that serve meals that fit with your lifestyle. You can also filter results based on specific meals served, ratings, and more. If you search for a specific meal, we'll provide you with colour-coded results to show you places that offer exactly what you're looking for, as well as options that provide meals similar to what you're looking for - in case you see something that tempts you!
						</p>
						<p>
							From the maps page you can tap on a restaurant's icon to open its mini card to get all the basic information you'll need. You can also find the best route to get there based off of your current location through our Google Maps integration.
						</p>
					</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Restaurants</h2>
						<p>
							You can access restaurant pages through meals or through the map. Restaurant pages offer more in-depth information than mini restaurant cards, which can be opened within the map page. On restaurant pages, you'll be able to see pictures, read reviews, check schedules, view menus, and list foods you've tried. This way, if you visit this restaurant again, it will be easy for you to pick something you enjoyed last time - or try something new!

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Create</h2>
						<p>
							Our create feature allows you to submit meal or restaurant pages to the community. This is an easy and quick process, and helps grow our database so that we can be more useful to more travelers. Simply fill in the information needed, add a photo or two, and voila - you've helped your fellow Turnips!
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="c-tile">
					<div class="c-tile__body">
						<h2 class="t-title">Phrasebook</h2>
						<p>
							Want to ask a question about your meal, but don't speak the local language? Don't worry, we've got you covered! Our Phrasebook feature allows you to select from a catalogue of phrases we think might be useful for travelling veggies. This way, we can ensure that the translation we give you will be 100% accurate, resulting in significantly less misunderstandings and confusion than typing-based translation tools. Simply select one or more things you would like to tell the restaurant staff and hit "create". Your accurately translated phrase will appear, and can be saved for future use.

						<h2 class="t-title">Favourites</h2>
						<p>
							Through your travels, you'll probably find tons of meals and restaurants you love. Want to keep track of them? No problem - simply tap the heart icon on restaurant and meal cards to favourite them. This will store them on the favourite's page. Here, you can drag and drop your saved meals and restaurants into whatever order you like, or you can filter them based on date, location and more. You can also search through your favourites to find that one specific restaurant you were thinking of. If for some reason you would like the remove a meal from your favourites, simply uncheck the heart icon. Super easy, super convenient.

						<p>
							We've tried to create a useful and convenient app for travelling vegans and vegetarians, to try and simplify their foreign-restaurant experience. We want to take the stress and worry out of the equation and leave you with nothing but excitement for your next delicious, veggie meal. Allow us to show you just how many delicious meals that meet your needs are waiting just around the corner - anywhere in the world. So, who's hungry?
